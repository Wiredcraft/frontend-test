# Masonry Layout - Wiredcraft Frontend Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Development
### `npm install or yarn add` to download the node-modules files
### `npm run json-server` to start a localhost service on the port 3001
### `npm run start` to start the task project

## Thoughts
I decided to spend the weekend to do this task from the scratch. To be frank, i have been quite
shameful about the last version i commited and i know i have to make it correct. About this version, perhaps it's not so good either, but it's better. And I'll be very appreciated if you guys could check it.
