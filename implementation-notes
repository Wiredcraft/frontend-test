This is a javascript oriented implementation.
It's based on React and with no other external dependencies.

Since I don't have `sketch` installed on my machine, the styles I got may be slightly differenet.
Some part of the styles/fonts files/icon files described in the sketch file may be missing,
and some of the styles attributes like `padding` are arbitraryly chosed.

The page's divided into three parts: the header, the filter, the table.

The header should respond to the location changes.

The filter bar can be used to search by types or by keywords.
    - what `type` exactly means is not specified, so I use two self-defined types: big and small, 
        depending on if the `lsat input` is bigger than 100.
    - by click on the search button, only the regions with its state name containning the input text will be shown.

The table is responsive, it also works on phone.
